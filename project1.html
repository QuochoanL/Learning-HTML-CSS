    <p>Coding has opened my eyes to new jobs, a perspective in which I can 
    work from a computer and always be learning to keep up with the coding languages.
    I started to learn about a few days ago, and for web development, I learned
    that HTML is fundamental to provide text to a webpage where as CSS helps format the page 
    and makes it look beautiful. On top of that Javascript is run on the hosts computer to 
    run animations etc. I know I have a long way to go but this is a start.</p>
    
    <p>To be a web developer, through research and looking everywhere on the internet I found that
      I must learn: </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <ul>
      <li> HTML </li>
      <li> CSS </li>
      <li> JavaScript </li>
      <li> Photoshop </li>
      <li> JQuery </li>
      <li> Sass </li>
      <li> Nodejs </li>
      <li> Git/Github </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <p> I know that this is just the beginning and people call this front end web designer and not a full web developer 
      because I still need to know back end coding, and servers, HTTP, etc but step by steps. </p>
    <p> I made a blog to go from 0 - 100 well not that I ever could be perfect in the ever growing market
      for programming but I think you know what I mean </p>
